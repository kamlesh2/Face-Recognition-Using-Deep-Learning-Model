# Face-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning-Model
In this project, we modified a Siamese Neural Network deep learning model to improve its facial recognition accuracy. After modifying this model, we compared it with the available models and trained all the models on diï¿½erent types of datasets containing facial images.
