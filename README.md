# Face-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning-Model

In this project, I modified a Siamese Neural Network deep learning model to improve its facial recognition accuracy. 

After modifying this model, I compared it with the available models and trained all the deep learning models on different types of datasets which is containing facial images.
